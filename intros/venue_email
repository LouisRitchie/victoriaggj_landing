Hello,

This is Louis from the uVic Game Dev Club.

We're hosting the 2017 Global Game Jam from 2pm on January 20th, to 7pm on January 22nd.

This event is a 48-hour long game development competition, where participants form teams to rapidly develop a video game. The event includes catering, 24-hour access, t-shirt giveaways, and free beer on the Sunday.

We expect roughly 50 participants each with their own computer gear; thus, we would need enough power outlets to support tens of power bars, as well as an internet connection that can withstand more than 50 people using it at the same time.

If this sounds like the kind of event your venue can support, I'd love to talk more. My phone number is 250-299-6100, please call anytime.

Thanks!

Louis Ritchie
Uvic Game Dev Club
