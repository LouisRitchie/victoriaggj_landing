  <h1>Volunteering for the Global Game Jam</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Louis Ritchie is the event organizer. 
      Any questions you have should be directed to him 
      either in the <a href="http://uvgd.slack.com">UVic GameDev Club slack channel<a>, 
      by email at louiscritchie@gmail.com,
      or to the UVGD club email at uvgd@uvic.ca.
    </li>
    <li>
      We need volunteers to help with registration, 
      directing jammers (participants), setting up and taking down AV equipment, 
      and helping jammers with any questions they have regarding 
      the structure of the game jam. There are important deadlines for registering 
      teams and submitting their games, so part of your job will be making sure 
      our jammers know when these deadlines are.
    </li>
    <li>
      In exchange for your volunteering, you'll be fed and given the same t-shirt as 
      participants recieve <strong>except in the case that we run out of food 
      or t-shirts.</strong> Jammers are paying $25 to participate and so they get 
      top priority for being fed and getting a shirt. That said, unless there is unexpectedly
      large turnout, you should be able to get a shirt and a meal after your volunteering shift.
    </li>
