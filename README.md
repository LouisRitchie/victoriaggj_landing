# 2017 Global Game Jam
## Victoria, BC

### [victoriaggj.com](http://victoriaggj.com)

This is the repo that holds the code for the GGJ Victoria 2017 Landing site,
as well as the code for the thank-you pages that are being sent to the sponsors.

You'll need to `npm install` to get everything working, then just open `index.html`.

There are steps you must take to bundle the thank-you pages with Gulp. Those instructions 
can be found [here](https://github.com/louisritchie/gamejam-thank-you-pages).
